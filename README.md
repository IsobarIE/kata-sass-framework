# Kata Sass Framework

This is a custom Sass framework/boilerplate developed by Isobar Ireland. It's mostly based on the [7-1 architecture pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) by Hugo Giraudel and in line with Isobar's own opinionated code guidelines [**Link to Kata website**]. We also use Susy to build our custom grid [**link to Kata website] as it provides the most flexibility on a project by project basis.

Our naming conventions are loosely based on the SMACSS arcitecture (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS), which keeps things simple and clear. It's also important to remember that sometimes architecture will need to differ based on the project so this is not an "unbreakable" rule.

Each folder of the framework has its own `README.md` file to explain the purpose and add extra information. Make sure to browse the repository to see how it all works.
